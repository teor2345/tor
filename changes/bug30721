  o Minor bugfixes (networking):
    - When parsing addreses via Tor's internal DNS lookup API, reject IPv4
      addresses in square brackets, and accept IPv6 addresses in square
      brackets. This change completes the work started in 23082, making
      address parsing consistent between tor's internal DNS lookup and address
      parsing APIs. Fixes bug 30721; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.
