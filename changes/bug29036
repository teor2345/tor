  o Minor bugfix (continuous integration):
    - Reset coverage state on disk after Travis CI has finished. This is being
      done to prevent future gcda file merge errors which causes the test suite
      for the process subsystem to fail. The process subsystem was introduced
      in 0.4.0.1-alpha. Fixes bug 29036; bugfix on 0.2.9.15.
