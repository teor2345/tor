  o Minor bugfixes (logging):
    - If we encounter a bug when flushing a buffer to a TLS connection,
      only log the bug once per invocation of the Tor process.  Previously we
      would log with every occurrence, which could cause us to run out of
      disk space.  Fixes bug 33093; bugfix on 0.3.2.2-alpha.
