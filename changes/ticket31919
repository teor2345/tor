  o Minor features (developer tools, git scripts, continuous integration):
    - Add a script to "scripts/coccinelle" that checks that new code
      is parseable by Coccinelle. Add an exceptions file for unparseable
      files. Call the script from a 'check-cocci' Makefile target, the
      git commit and push hooks, and Travis CI. This change ensures that
      our coccinelle parsing quality will not degrade over time.
      Closes ticket 31919.
  o Minor features (continuous integration):
    - Use Ubuntu Bionic images for our Travis CI builds, so we can get
      a recent version of coccinelle. But leave chutney on Ubuntu Trusty,
      until we can fix some Bionic permissions issues (see ticket 32240).
      Related to ticket 31919.
