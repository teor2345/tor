  o Testing:
    - In our Appveyor Windows CI, set PKG_CONFIG_PATH before running
      configure. And copy required DLLs to test and app, before running tor's
      tests. This ensures that tor.exe and test*.exe use the correct version
      of each DLL. Fixes OpenSSL version test failures.
      Fixes bug 33643; bugfix on 0.3.4.2-alpha.
