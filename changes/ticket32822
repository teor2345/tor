  o Minor features (directory authorities, IPv6):
    - Make authorities add their IPv6 ORPort (if any) to the trusted dir
      servers list. Authorities currently add themselves to the trusted dir
      servers list, but they only add their IPv4 address and ports to the list.
      Closes ticket 32822.
