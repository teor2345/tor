  o Major bugfixes (bridges):
    - Do not count previously configured working bridges towards our total of
      working bridges. Previously, when Tor's list of bridges changed, it
      would think that the old bridges were still usable, and delay fetching
      router descriptors for the new ones.  Fixes part of bug 29875; bugfix
      on 0.3.0.1-alpha.
    - Consider our directory information to have changed when our list of
      bridges changes. Previously, Tor would not re-compute the status of its
      directory information when bridges changed, and therefore would not
      realize that it was no longer able to build circuits. Fixes part of bug
      29875.
