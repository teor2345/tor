  o Minor features (onion services):
    - Version 3 onion services can now use HiddenServiceExportRendPoint
      to get the IP and port of the rendezvous point they are connecting to.
    - Version 3 onion services can now use HiddenServiceExportInstanceID
      which enables them to differenciate traffic when multiple tor
      instances share the same backend.
    - Closes ticket 32604. Patch by Moonsik Park.
