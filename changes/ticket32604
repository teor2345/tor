  o Minor features (onion services):
    - When HiddenServiceExportCircuitID is set, version 3 onion
      services can also set HiddenServiceExportRendPoint to
      export the first 12 hex digits of the rendezvous point's
      fingerprint using the haproxy protocol.
    - When HiddenServiceExportCircuitID is set, version 3 onion
      services can also set HiddenServiceExportInstanceID to
      differenciate traffic when multiple tor instances share
      the same backend. Closes ticket 32604. Patch by Moonsik Park.
